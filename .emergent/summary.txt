The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack chat application named Aylla from scratch, following an iterative process with continuous user feedback. The development began with a pixel-perfect frontend replication based on a provided HTML/CSS description, using React and Shadcn UI components with mock data. Key features implemented include a responsive sidebar, dynamic top navigation, and a main chat interface.

Subsequent iterations focused on refining the user experience and expanding functionality. The logo was updated multiple times with user-provided assets, and a flexible login system with optional authentication and personalized, context-aware greetings was introduced. A robust theme switcher for light/dark modes was integrated, along with a subtle, dynamic watermark in the chat interface. Significant effort was dedicated to bug fixing, specifically a  React error, which involved refactoring to use unique keys, proper event handling, and memoization techniques.

Most recently, the focus shifted to the core chat functionality, integrating an educational knowledge base covering PDDE and pedagogical topics, ensuring all conversations are in Brazilian Portuguese. The AI engineer was in the process of enhancing greeting responsiveness and expanding PDDE knowledge at the point of handover. The application is now fully functional, visually aligned with user requirements, and prepared for AWS integration.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a full-stack, pixel-perfect clone of an educational chat application named Aylla. The application should feature a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Key features and design requirements:**
*   **Initial UI Replication**: Replicate a detailed chat interface design, including a left sidebar (navigation, conversation history), a top navigation bar (tabs like Chat, Meu Painel, Agenda, Alertas, Documentos), and a main chat area with greetings, prompt suggestions, and an input field.
*   **Branding**: Incorporate the Aylla logo, which was updated multiple times with specific SVG and JPG assets. The logo should appear in the sidebar and main chat area.
*   **Theming**: Implement both light and dark themes, with a toggle button and smooth transitions. The theme preference should persist.
*   **Watermark**: A subtle Aylla logo watermark should be present in the chat interface, with varied opacities and rotations, and only visible on the chat screen.
*   **Login System**: Develop an optional login screen with username/password fields and a Continue without login option. The login system should allow any credentials for testing and persist user login.
*   **Personalized Greetings**: Dynamic, responsive greetings based on the time of day (Bom dia, Boa tarde, Boa noite) and customized with the logged-in user's name or a default (Sr. Oriovaldo). The greetings should rotate automatically every 2 minutes and offer a manual refresh.
*   **User Experience (UX)**: Ensure pixel-perfect design, correct fonts (Lato, Lexend, Inter), proper color schemes (Brand Primary: #08215D, Accent: #07C9FD), consistent hover effects, smooth animations, and optimized whitespace.
*   **Chat Intelligence**: Implement a chat conversation system with a knowledge base on education, PDDE (Programa Dinheiro Direto na Escola), and general pedagogical topics, with responses strictly in Brazilian Portuguese. The AI's responses should display the Aylla logo.
*   **Deployment Readiness**: Application should be production-ready for the Emergent platform, using environment variables for URLs, local assets for images, and compatible with Kubernetes ingress rules.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the chat's intelligence and personalization. The user explicitly requested to:
1.  **Create conversations via chat with knowledge in education, PDDE, and general pedagogical topics.** This involved creating  and  to handle mock responses based on these topics.  and  were updated to integrate this conversational logic.
2.  **Ensure conversation is in Portuguese.** The  was adjusted to guarantee all simulated responses are in Brazilian Portuguese, using natural language.
3.  **Place the Aylla logo in chat icons when the AI responds.**  was modified so that messages originating from the AI would display the Aylla logo next to them, visually distinguishing AI responses.
4.  **Set the greeting to Sr. Oriovaldo and make the proactive conversation icon identical to the system's login icon.**  was updated to fix the greeting to Sr. Oriovaldo and to align the icon styling for consistency.

The very last instruction from the user was saudações responsivas cordiais e personalizadas, bom dia, boa tarde, boa noite, coloque conhecimento no PDDE. This is the task the previous engineer was about to start, implying further refinements to the greeting system and expanding the educational knowledge base. The application currently supports a basic intelligent chat in Portuguese, displays the Aylla logo for AI responses, and uses Sr. Oriovaldo as the default greeting with a consistent icon style.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue by implementing the responsive, cordial, and personalized greetings based on the time of day and further expanding the PDDE knowledge base for the chat system.
